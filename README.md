BLISS - Intellivision Emulator
==============================
Originally developed by Kyle Davis

Contributions by Jesse Litton, Mike Dunston, Joseph Zbiciak

This fork is maintained by Jeremiah Sypult with a focus on adding cross-platform support (primarily targeting OS X).

Development
-----------

### Windows

The solution and project files are currently versioned for Visual Studio .NET 2003. The Direct X SDK is required to build. Support for building with Visual Studio Express is unknown since the project makes use of MFC.

Requirements
------------
Backup BIOS/ROMs from the original Intellivision are required to run Bliss.

The BIOS ROMs must be placed in the Bliss application folder (Windows) and are named:
- exec
- grom
- ivoice
- ecs

History
-------
Code history resurrected via CVS from http://sourceforge.net/projects/blissemu/ with the latest bits of the last known version (2.0.5) from a SVN checkout (hosted at a server that is now offline).
