v2.1.0 - October 27, 2014
- Added support for saving and loading Intellivision game states.
- Refactored code for multi-platform support.
  See https://github.com/jeremiah-sypult/BlissEmu and
  https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu

v2.0.5 - May 25, 2005
- Added support for the Classic Game Controller (CGC).
  See http://www.shiny-technologies.com/cgc.php for details on this device.
- Added initial support for Atari 5200 games. Nothing playable yet, but
  graphics are visible for several games.

v2.0.4 - May 14, 2005
- Significantly updated the input configuration capabilities to include the
  following additions, changes, and fixes:
    - Added the ability to bind a combination of inputs to each emulated
      input. This allows you to use multi-key or multi-button combinations as
      an input.
    - Added the ability to bind more than one set of inputs to each emulated
      input. This allows more than one key configurations to activate the same
      emulated input, allowing you to have two joysticks simultaneously mapped
      to the same hand controller, for example.
    - Added the ability to clear all input bindings and configure all inputs
      at once, simplifying the input configuration process.
    - Added the ability to reset an input binding, leaving it completely
      unbound if you don't intend to use it.
    - ECS keyboard inputs are sorted into a more logical order in the input
      configuration window.
    - Changed the input configuration dialog to be resizeable.
    - Fixed a bug with the input configuration dialog where you could not
      configure the ENTER or SPACE keyboard keys.
- In full-screen mode, the mouse cursor now times out and automatically
  disappears after a few seconds with no mouse movement.
- Added the ability to pause the game currently in progress (Alt+P).
- Fixed the bug where the Intellivoice would only speak during the title screen
  of the Intellivoice games, but would not speak the in-game phrases. The
  Intellivoice emulation now properly speaks all phrases.
- Fixed a bug where the ECS keyboard was not being scanned, which prevented
  use of the keyboard in the games that require it.
- Fixed a problem where Bliss wouldn't play nice if you tried to switch to
  another application while in full-screen mode. You can now switch between
  apps with no problems while in full-screen mode.
- Fixed the icon for the settings dialog.
- Made a minor change to graphics rendering to try to fix the graphics glitch
  of offset pixels running in a line from the lower left to the upper right that
  occured on some video cards.
- Settings dialog now correctly selects the first item in the tree every time
  the options window is displayed.
- Accelerator keys are now shown in the window menus.

v2.0.3 - April 25, 2005
- Fixed a bug where I was accidentally requesting a DirectX device with
  hardware vertex processing, even though it's not required.  This prevented
  DirectX from initializing properly on any systems with video cards that
  do not support hardware vertex processing.
- Fixed a problem where the check for the file extension was case-sensitive,
  preventing filenames in ALL CAPS from loading correctly.
- Changed audio to flush the audio buffers on every video frame, resulting in
  significantly less jerky video output. The need for this was actually
  exposed by the fix in 2.0.2 that removed video output as the performance
  bottleneck.
- Name of the game being played is now displayed in the window title.
- Added the ability to start up in fullscreen mode using "/fullscreen" or
  "-fullscreen". Useful for the various emulator front-ends.

v2.0.2 - April 25, 2005
- Fixed a major performance bottleneck in the use of the Direct3D Present()
  function. Turns out there is a big difference between "IMMEDIATE" and
  "DONOTWAIT" that the Direct3D docs don't exactly make clear. The end result
  is that the emulation should be MUCH smoother for everyone in this release.
- Enabled Electronic Computer System (ECS) support. Games that used the ECS
  now work correctly, including The Jetsons, Melody Blaster, Mind Strike,
  Mr. Basic, Scooby Doo's Maze Chase, the Song Players, and World Series
  Major League Baseball. The input configuration dialog still needs some
  cleanup work related to the ECS, but at least it's functional for now.
- Added support for banked ROMs in cartridges. As a result, World Series Major
  League Baseball now works correctly.
- Fixed several collision detection problems (Space Spartans, Mouse Trap, etc.)
- Reworked .bin/.int support to no longer use bin2rip.exe. The database of
  known cartridges is exposed in the file "knowncarts.cfg". If you update
  this file to add new cartridges or fix existing mappings, please send
  me your updates so others can benefit.
- Several carts in .bin/.int format that were not loading properly are
  now working (AD&D Treasure of Tarmin, for example).
- Added support for cartridge RAM. Land Battle and USCF Chess are now
  working.
- Added .zip support. Bliss will search for the first .bin or .int file
  found in the .zip that matches a known configuration in the "knowncarts.cfg"
  database and attempt to load it.
- Reworked .rom support to no longer use rom2rip.exe

v2.0.1 - April 10, 2005
- Enabled Intellivoice support. Note that World Series Major League Baseball
  is still not working, however, due to a lack of support for ROM banking and
  a lack of ECS support.
- Fixed graphical glitches that were occuring in some games
- Added the ability to pass a rom filename on the command line for Bliss
  to run immediately on startup
- Changed open dialog to be resizable

v2.0.0 - April 8, 2005
- First release
